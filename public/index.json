[{"content":"\u003ch3 id=\"about-application\"\u003eAbout application\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis project represents the culmination of my academic journey as a Bachelor\u0026rsquo;s degree student, serving as the final year project that synthesizes and applies the knowledge and skills acquired throughout my undergraduate studies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMedScan Insight\u003c/strong\u003e is a web application designed to predict diseases based on the user\u0026rsquo;s symptoms. It utilizes machine learning to make predictions and is built on the Flask framework. The dataset used for training and testing was obtained from the Kaggle dataset \u003ca href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/karthikudyawar/disease-symptom-prediction\"\u003ePredict Disease Symptom\u003c/a\u003e. It was trained and tested using a decision tree algorithm, which is also employed to ask symptom-related questions based on the user\u0026rsquo;s initial input.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe project aims to allow users to diagnose illnesses from home, which is particularly beneficial during times such as the COVID-19 pandemic when visiting clinics may not be feasible. Users can input their symptoms and receive potential diagnoses, empowering them to take charge of their health. They can learn about possible diseases, understand the condition, and know how to care for themselves before making the decision to visit a clinic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe application is a web-based platform built using the Flask framework. The required libraries for the project can be found in the [requirements.txt].

First, I try to see how Flight Number (which indicates continuous launch attempts) and Payload variables affect the launch outcome. For payload mass exceeding 10,000 kg, the launch attempts are more successful compared to those with lower payload masses.

Based on the scatterplot, CCAFS SLC 40 and KSC LC 39A have a 100 percent success rate for flight numbers above 80. Although KSC LC 39A has no data below 20 Flight Numbers, its success rate for between 40 and 65 Flight Numbers is also 100 percent. CCAFS SLC 40 has launched more flights than the other two launch sites.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"/projects/spacex/flightnumber_site.png\" alt=\"FlightNumber x LaunchSite\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBased on the relationship between payload mass and launch site, CCAFS launch site has the most flights.
