[{"content":"\u003ch3 id=\"about-application\"\u003eAbout application\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis project represents the culmination of my academic journey as a Bachelor\u0026rsquo;s degree student, serving as the final year project that synthesizes and applies the knowledge and skills acquired throughout my undergraduate studies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMedScan Insight is a web application designed to predict the diseases with the user\u0026rsquo;s symptoms. It utilized machine learning to predict the diseases and build upon the Flask framework. The dataset to train and test was obtained from the Kaggle dataset \u003ca href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/karthikudyawar/disease-symptom-prediction\"\u003ePredict Disease Symptom\u003c/a\u003e. It was trained and predicted using decision tree algorithm and also utilized the decision tree to ask the question of the symptoms based on the user\u0026rsquo;s first input symptom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe project aims to allow users to diagnose illnesses from home, which is particularly beneficial during times such as the COVID-19 pandemic when visiting clinics may not be feasible. Users can input their symptoms and receive potential diagnoses, empowering them to take charge of their health. Users can know about what kind of diseases may have, the condition and how to take care before making the decision to go to clinic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe application is a web-based platform built using the Flask framework. The required libraries for the project can be found in the [requirements.txt].

First, I try to see how FlightNumber (indicating the continuous launch attempts.) and Payload variables would affect the launch outcome. For payload mass exceeding 10,000 kg, the launch attempts are more successful compared to those with lower payload masses. Starting from the 79th attempt, all launches have been successful regardless of the payload mass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"/projects/spacex/payload_flightnumber.png\" alt=\"Payload x FlightNumber\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter that, I try to find the patterns between the FlightNumber and Launchsite based on the success rate for landing. Based on the scatterplot, CCAFS SLC 40 and KSC LC 39A has the 100 percentage success rate for above 80 Flight Number. Although KSC LC 39A has no data below 20 FlightNumber, its success rate for between 40 and 65 Flight Number is also 100 percentage. CCAFS SLC 40 has launched more flight than other two launch sites.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"/projects/spacex/flightnumber_site.png\" alt=\"FlightNumber x LaunchSite\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBased on the relationship between payload and launch site, CCAFS launch site has the most flight than other site. VAFB SLC 4E site doesn\u0026rsquo;t launch the flight that weighted more than 10,000 payload mass. KSC LC 39A site has 100% success in launching the flight that weighted between 2000 and 5000 payload mass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"/projects/spacex/payload_launchsite.png\" alt=\"Payload x LaunchSite\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdditionally, I analyze the average success rate over the year.
