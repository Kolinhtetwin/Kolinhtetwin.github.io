      <description>About application This project represents the culmination of my academic journey as a Bachelor&amp;rsquo;s degree student, serving as the final year project that synthesizes and applies the knowledge and skills acquired throughout my undergraduate studies.&#xA;MedScan Insight is a web application designed to predict diseases based on the user&amp;rsquo;s symptoms. It utilizes machine learning to make predictions and is built on the Flask framework. The dataset used for training and testing was obtained from the Kaggle dataset Predict Disease Symptom.</description>
